1. What's the difference between let and const?
2. What is the 'i' in a loop? (eg: for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)) What happens to the 'i' during
the loop execution?
3. What are the different ways to get an element from the DOM?
4. How do you get an element from an array at a specific index? 
5. How can you convert a string ("4") into a number? Why or when would you do this?
6. We have learned the 'click' event listener. What are three others (or MANY) that can be
added to a DOM element?
7. How do you create a DOM element using JS?
8. How come we can use 'forEach' but not a 'for loop' on an HTML collection?
9. How does 'this' work in JS? (this is a multidimensional question and we haven't covered it all yet!)
10. Can you describe the main difference between a forEach loop and a .map() loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
